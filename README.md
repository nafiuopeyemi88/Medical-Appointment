Results of the analysis

*Conclusions*
Some columns have shown relationship with no-show while others have been neutral in influencing patients not showing up, to their medical appointments.

Age_group for example shows positive relationship with patients not showing up for appointments, although it will be erroneous to categorically conclude the ages of patient is the singular most important factor deciding whether they will show.

Also incentives like SMS_received has show to be related, leaddays which is the number of days between the appointment and when it was scheduled is related to patients not showing up.
